Heat Rules.

1	→ initial test of particle changing color by proximity.
2	→ two particles falling and colliding.
3	→ trying multiple particles from random locations.
4	→ oscillating swarm.
6	→ orbiting and oscillating swarm.
6-b	→ compact light.
	+ reduce the entropy of the orbit to keep their movement up.
6-c	→ 
6-c1	→ 
6-c2	→ 
6-c3	→ 
6-c4	→ fire works.
6-c5	→ fire works again.
6-c6	→ compress and then makes a purple projecticle.
6-c7	→ compresses into a stable orbit.
6-c8	→ from projecticle to orbit.
6-c9	→ somewhat stable explosions.
6-c10	→ orbitng the center.
6-c11	→ groups in fixed angle round.
6-c12	→ unstable but somewhat fixed locations in orbit.
6-c13	→ unclear behavior.
6-c14	→ 

7	→ orbiting swarm.
8	→ oscillating swarm.
8-b	→ like a fireplace with particles being pushed out on the bottom corners.
9	→ like a fireplace with particles raining (pushed out).
9-b	→ 5 heat particles that oscillate to eachother, and others following.
10	→ erratic behavior.
11	→ pulsing or beating heart. it centers and expands.
12	→ like red cells that dive into walls and explode.
12-b	→ 
12-c	→ wave patterns of space and color.
	+ Try more particles.
12-d	→ evenly spread out groups.
13	→ blue orbs interacting and losing their stability.
14	→ stables fast at first. makes an orbiting swarm.
15	→ the color change looks like fire already.
16	→ pop corn.
17	→ consistent erratic behavior. like visual effect of a superpower.
18	→ the oscillation looks like waves crashing on a rock.
19	→ looks like fireworks on the corners, and a constant ocean in the center.
20	→ more explosive but wave returning.



consider adding to draw:
if(e.hue < 0) {console.log(`id:${e.id}, hue: ${e.hue};`)}
