## Description of Project
This is a game idea that involves strategic choices and math.

Consider a grid of numbers. There is a start and an end. You are allowed to move to numbers 7 higher or lower to your current number. Higher numbers can’t be climbed, and lower numbers will hurt and reduce your health. How do you get to the end.


## Brainstorming Versions

### Initial:
You can only climb or fall 7 numbers away from the number you are currently in.

### Additions:
* [Falling & Health] You have a health bar, falling to numbers that are more than 7 of difference will add a penalty lowering your health, if it gets to zero, you fail.
* [Life Timer] You have a timer in the form of energy, you lose one of 100 every turn.
(example) There could be a path that is simple, until a cliff and you would lose 10 hp, against going around and you would lose 2 because it is a longer path.
* [Moving Terrain] **Consider moving terrain, like rotating tiles that could make a path more accessible if you calculate how long it would take getting there or it would reduce damage if one waits a turn or two.
**Maybe one is a path in a wall that could act as a bridge that oscillates. Maybe it requires activation.
* [Energy Packs] Consider paths with energy packages, it could be a longer path, but you’ll regenerate what you lose, or even more.
* [Enemies] Consider enemies that would reduce your health, but they could have loot that could be advantageous.
* [Power Ups] Consider power ups, like allowing for higher jumps or for dampening larger falls.
* [Unexplored Map & Fog] Consider fog in the map, 
Perhaps a skill for observing a larger area around by sending a small observer but it costs 10 energy.
The strategy would require for higher ground to observe more.
* [Allies] Consider having allies that would add the cost but their skills could compensate if they can observe farther or collect more energy from energy packages by efficiently converting them.
* [Quest Items] (+) Consider quest items, adding reward benefits like more resources for having more allies or unlocking allies or power ups.
* [Water Currents] (+) Consider currents, it could reduce fall damage, but adds energy cost to go against the current and adds distance moved going with the current.
* [Railroads] (+) Consider railroads, it allows for safety travels but start, pause, end could cost energy.
* [Goal & Nexus] (+) Consider an overarching goal, maybe all the progress is to get to a castle of traps and enemies and the entrance to new lands.
* [unk] (+) Consider neutral creatures but can be used for labor, resources, or can attack if provoked. Disrupting ecosystems can affect the world.
* [unk] (+) Consider world without open lands but empty parts like vacuum and jumping asteroids, or a maze in paths, but fall damage is permanent.
* [unk] (+) Consider magnetic holds to go on walls adding more dimensions to the map.
* [unk] (+) Consider flight but limited by time and energy costs. Gliding could be another mechanic but only reducing part of the damage.
* [unk] (+) Consider viscosity that reduces movement by adding cost. Different fluids could have other effects like add bounce, reaction to fire or conduct electricity.
* [unk] (+) Consider metalíceme paths that get electrified every some time and can be turned off but it would cost time to go away of the shortest path.
* [unk] (+) Consider air paths were winds add the cost of energy for flight.
